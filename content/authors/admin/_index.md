Md. Al-Amin Khandaker is a Research Engineer at the Research and Development department of EAGLYS Inc, Tokyo where he is currently working on application of fully homomorphic encryption on privacy-preserving machine learning and secure computing for real-world problem.

In 2015 he was awarded Japan Govt. Scholarship (MEXT) to pursue Doctor’s course in the field of cryptography under the supervision of Professor Yasuyuki NOGAMI.
His Ph.D. research was focused on optimization and efficient implementation techniques for the elliptic curve pairing-based cryptography, and its application for IoT security. He was a graduate student member of IEEE.

His current research interest is fully homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation and their application in machine learning and NLP.


<!-- K is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
