summary: Invided talk on Pairing-Based Cryptography and Open-Source Library.
abstract: "Pairing-based cryptography is popular among the cryptographic protocol researchers for its eccentric provable security. Protocol side researchers often see pairing as a black box. They often need to test the correctness of their proposal. Typically, mathematicians and cryptography engineers try to make the underlying operations of pairing-based crypto efficient. In addition, different types of pairing and pairing-friendly curves have varying pros and cons with respect to the design of protocol and parameter. All these led us to make a distributable and efficient library that will incorporate various pairing-friendly curves with the different security levels. In this talk, I will share the path we followed to make such library for all who are working directly or indirectly with pairing-based cryptography."
