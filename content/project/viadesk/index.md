### Key contributions

I worked on this product for three and a half years. At that time I developed several core features for its iOS native client(mostly used Objective-C, before swift adopted).

- Made technical specifications (Class and Sequence diagram) from Bizness requirements.
- Developed new features and fixed bugs.
- Among the technical challenges of this project; are offline file management, caching, custom calendar, and securing files inside the app sandbox.
